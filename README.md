NormalPicker is a 3D normal-color palette made in the Godot engine. It was made to assist with 2D sprite normal painting by allowing the artist to see the real angle of the normal-color they are picking when they pick it.

To use it, run or export it from Godot 4.2. Click on the sphere with the mouse to select a normal. Press the middle mouse and drag to rotate the view. There are buttons to swap between orthographic and perspective views and between a smooth sphere or a flat-shaded, low-poly sphere.

When you have the angle you want, the text representations can be copied.
